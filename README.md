Steps to using this search engine:

1) Load up the code into your IDE of choice, place the folder of what you want to index in the same folder as the two programs.
  - main is used for indexing the files, query is used for searching.
2) Run the 'main' python program (the default folder for indexing is the '/DEV' folder)
  - This should take one to three hours depending on your computer specs.
3) After the 'main' program has completed running, run the 'query' python program.
4) After the GUI pops up, search as you wish.
5) Exit by pressing the exit button of the GUI and closing the IDE.
